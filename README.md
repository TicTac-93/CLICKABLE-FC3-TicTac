# RedK0d Clickable Cockpits Continued
 NOTE: If you found this repo from the RedK0d page, it is NOT functional!  I'm currently working on building an understanding of the mod and reconstructing it in a clean repo.
 
 Due to ED's stance on mod IP, the fact that RedK0d is MIA, and that the original mod did not have a license posted, I might need to rebuild this from scratch.  Hopefully it isn't too difficult to recreate at least the basic functionality -- I have no plans to try and expand the capabilities of the FC3 / FC24 aircraft, only to provide clickable cockpits that hook into the existing keybinds.

------------------------------

 A partially clickable mod for the FC3 Planes.  Originally created by RedK0d, I noticed some issues with the A-10A cockpit (and many with the F-15C) and decided to update it.  I think the FC jets are a great deal, and being able to interact with their cockpits makes the experience of flying them so much more enjoyable.  Not to mention easier than memorizing 101 keybinds!

 Supported
 * Su-27  
 * J-11A  
 * Su-33  
 * Su-25T
